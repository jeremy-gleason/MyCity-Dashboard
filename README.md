# MyCity Data Dashboard

## Overview

MyCity Dashboard is an all-in-one system to retrieve and analyze data pertaining to the city of Philadelphia. It parses datasets from the OpenDataPhilly repository, processing over 500,000 population, property, and Covid-19 records in order to perform analysis across a variety of metrics.

## Implementation Details

MyCity is developed in Java, using a multitier architecture and object-oriented best practices. It's composed of packages that parse massive JSON datasets, perform detailed analysis as specified by the user, and display the results in an easy-to-use interface. It was built using test-driven development with JUnit and makes use of software design patterns and memoization to ensure high quality code and efficient performance.

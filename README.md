# MyCity Data Dashboard

## Overview

MyCity Dashboard provides the tools to retrieve and analyze important data about your local city. It parses/processes public datasets to generate a large store of information about your local area which you can then analyze across a variety of metrics.

## Implementation Details

MyCity is developed in Java, using an n-tier architecture and object-oriented best practices. It's composed of packages that parse massive datasets, perform detailed analysis as specified by the user, and display the results in an easy-to-use interface. It was built using test-driven development with JUnit and makes use of software design patterns and memoization to ensure high quality code and efficient performance.

## Usage/Access

This program was built as an extension of a school project, and the source code is being kept private in accordance with university policies. If you would like to know more please [contact me](mailto:jeremygleason@icloud.com) and I can walk you through the project's code.
